I am currently enrolled in **[Master LLM Engineering & AI Agents: Build 14 Projects – 2025](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-an-llm-agentic-ai-engineer-14-day-bootcamp-2025)** on Udemy.

As part of this course, I have completed the following projects:

1. **Character\_AI\_Chatbot** :<br>
   Developed a chatbot powered by the OpenAI API that mimics the personality and voice of a chosen character. Users can interact with fictional or custom personas - such as Sherlock Holmes, a pirate, or any imagined character and receive responses crafted in that character’s unique style and tone.
